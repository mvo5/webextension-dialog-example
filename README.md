# Webextension example that uses a dialog

A webextension example that creates a dialog when clicking on
a text entry and lets you enter the text inside the extension
window.

Mostly useful as an example how to create extensions with
dialogs. Might also be useful if you want to avoid the website
to see each of your keystrokes.
